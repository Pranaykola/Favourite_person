        <h1 style="color: rgb(6, 5, 5);">Dr. A.P.J Abdul Kalam</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 22px; color: rgb(82, 75, 75);">Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, whose full name was Avul Pakir
            Jainulabdeen Abdul
            Kalam, stands as one of India’s most revered scientists and leaders. Born on October 15, 1931, in
            Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, into a humble family, he overcame early financial hardships through determination
            and hard work. Kalam’s academic journey began at St. Joseph’s College, Tiruchirappalli, where he studied
            Physics, followed by Aeronautical Engineering at the Madras Institute of Technology.

            Kalam’s career began at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) in 1958, and he later
            joined the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). At ISRO, he played a pivotal role in developing
            India’s first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-3), which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in 1980,
            marking a major milestone in India’s space program. His leadership in missile technology, particularly with
            the Agni and Prithvi missiles, earned him the title “Missile Man of India”. He was instrumental in advancing
            India’s nuclear capabilities, notably during the Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998.</p>

        <h1 style="color: rgb(6, 5, 5);">Swami Vivekananda</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 22px; color: rgb(82, 75, 75);">Born Narendranath Datta in 1863, Swami Vivekananda wasn't
            just a monk; he was a whirlwind of intellect, spirituality, and unwavering passion. He rose from the
            bustling streets of Calcutta to become the voice of India's ancient wisdom on the world stage, leaving an
            indelible mark on the 19th and 20th centuries. This essay delves into his remarkable journey, exploring his
            transformative teachings and their continued relevance in our lives.



            We in modern society often talk about our strengths and weaknesses but long ago in the 19th Century, a boy
            born in a middle-class Bengali family of Kolkata reached a divine stature in his life at an early age
            through his spiritual thoughts and simple living concepts. He said, “Strength is Life and Weakness is
            Death.” He also said, “Arise, awake, and stop not till the goal is reached. we are talking about Narendra
            Nath Dutta who later went on to become Swami Vivekananda, the monk. A student who during his college days
            was fond of music and sports like other young boys of his age completely transformed himself into a person
            of
            exceptional spiritual vision. His works "Modern Vedanta" and "Raj Yoga" are today acclaimed all over the
            world. </p>

        <p style="font-size: 22px; color: rgb(82, 75, 75);">Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first Prime Minister, was a
            pivotal figure in the nation's independence movement and its subsequent development as a modern nation. He
            was a prominent leader in the Indian National Congress, a close associate of Mahatma Gandhi, and a visionary

            freedom
            fighters and the first Prime Minister of independent India. Since he was such an important and inspirational
            figure for the country, children are taught about his personality and contributions. They are often asked to
            write a few lines about Jawaharlal Nehru in the form of a short note or Jawaharlal Nehru essay. Here are
            some lines on Jawaharlal Nehru in the form of a long and a short Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru Essay is given.

        <h1 style="color: rgb(6, 5, 5);">Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 22px; color: rgb(82, 75, 75);">Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, often called the 'Father of the
            Nation', was a leader who fought for India's freedom from British rule. He believed in non-violence. Every
            year on October 2nd, Mahatma Gandhi's birthday is celebrated as Gandhi Jayanti to honour his efforts in
            freeing India.His idea of 'Ahimsa,' which means not hurting anyone, was widely admired and followed by many
            influential people worldwide. He became an indomitable figure who couldn't be defeated in any situation.
            Mahatma Gandhi initiated the 'Khadi Movement' to encourage the use of fabrics like khadi or jute..Gandhi
            strongly supported agriculture
            and encouraged people to engage in farming.
            He inspired Indians to embrace manual labour and emphasized self-reliance, urging them to provide for their
            needs and lead simple lives. He began weaving cotton clothes using the Charkha to reduce dependence on
            foreign goods and promote Swadeshi products among Indians.



            During the fight for India's freedom, Gandhiji faced imprisonment several times along with his followers,
            but his main goal was always the freedom of his motherland. Even when he was in prison, he never chose the
            path of violence.

        <h1 style="color: rgb(6, 5, 5);">Bhagat Singh</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 22px; color: rgb(82, 75, 75);">Bhagat Singh was a prominent Indian socialist revolutionary
            whose acts of defiance against the British Raj made him a hero of the Indian independence movement. Born in
            1907, he was deeply affected by events like the Jallianwala Bagh massacre and the death of Lala Lajpat Rai,
            which fueled his desire for revolutionary action. He joined the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association
            (HSRA) and participated in acts of protest, including the bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly and
            the assassination of British police officer John Saunders. Bhagat Singh was arrested, tried, and ultimately
            executed at the young age of 23, along with his associates Sukhdev and Rajguru, on March 23, 1931. His
            sacrifice and revolutionary ideals continue to inspire generations in India. Bhagat Singh was a courageous
            Indian freedom fighter who
            played a key role in India’s struggle for independence. An essay on Bhagat Singh helps students understand
            his life, values, and sacrifices. This topic is important in English writing for school assignments,
            competitive exams, and for inspiring patriotism in daily conversation. Vedantu provides easy resources to
            make this learning simple.</p>
